# LuminaAdapt

The Adaptive Night Light Controller page is a self‑contained, single‑page application that sits in your browser and talks to a local backend service to monitor your screen’s brightness, blue‑light intensity, and ambient light level—and then lets you turn on a warm “night‑light” overlay or adjust color temperature automatically.

Works on Linux

## Execution

  ```rust
  cargo run
  open index.html
  ```

or

```shell
./run.sh
```
